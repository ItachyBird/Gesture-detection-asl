Gesture Recognition Project
Description
This project is designed to recognize gestures using a machine learning model. The project leverages computer vision techniques and deep learning models to accurately classify gestures based on input data. The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook for model training and a Flask web application for deploying the model.

Project Structure
The project includes the following files:

gesture.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for training the gesture recognition model.
app.py: Flask web application for deploying the trained model.
Jupyter Notebook (gesture.ipynb)
Importing Libraries: Necessary libraries for computer vision, data manipulation, and machine learning are imported.
Setting Up Models: MediaPipe holistic model is used for feature extraction.
Data Processing: Data is processed and prepared for training.
Model Training: A Sequential model is built and trained using LSTM layers.
Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a test set.
Flask Application (app.py)
Setting Up Flask: The Flask application is initialized.
Model Loading: The trained gesture recognition model is loaded.
Video Streaming: The application captures video from a webcam, processes it, and performs gesture recognition in real-time.
Rendering Templates: The web interface is rendered using HTML templates.
Dependencies
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

Flask
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
MediaPipe
scikit-learn
Keras
TensorFlow
pyttsx3
You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

pip install flask opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib mediapipe scikit-learn keras tensorflow pyttsx3



The app.py file appears to be a Flask web application that utilizes MediaPipe for gesture recognition and incorporates various other libraries, such as OpenCV and Keras.

Here is the updated README.txt file that includes the app.py script:

Model not accurate

possible reasons:
1. training done without gpu
2. background noise
3. data feeding is less(minimum 500 images for 1 action for accurate result)
